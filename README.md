##Deploy Node app to AWS EB from Github via Semaphore

This is a sample Node app to deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk directly from Github.

I could not find a good tutorial, so sharing here.
Detailed instructions are coming...

Deployed app: http://default-environment.ycn9jgnj6p.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

#AWS EB
Go to the welcome page of AWS ElasticBeanstalk. At "Select a platform", choose Node and click "Launch now".
Setting up environment and sample app will take 3 to 5 minutes.
At the end, you will see dashboard of your application:
